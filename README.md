HUI is intended as a lightweight/minimal material design frontend framework. The initial idea was to build a visually appealing and an easy-to-use framework for developing apps supporting only modern browsers. It is not intended as a kitchen sink, however I would like to build components for real needs, so it might grow significantly over time.

You can easily use only the components you want, so the final build should contain only the necessary bits. HUI builds upon PostCSS and CSSNext with a focus on cascading styles and classes properly, so there would be as little style overrides as possible.
